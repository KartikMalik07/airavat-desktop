Airavat – Individual Elephant Identification System

An offline desktop application for identifying individual elephants from photographs.
Built with Electron (desktop UI) and a Python backend, it runs entirely on your local machine — no internet needed after installation.

Key Features

Offline Operation – Processes images without an internet connection.

Two AI Models (selectable in the interface):

Siamese Neural Network – Compares headshots.

YOLOv8 – Detects and matches right ear patterns.

High-Volume Processing – Works with image datasets up to ~200 GB (ZIP format).

Single Photo Search – Check if a specific elephant exists in your dataset.

Model Testing – Run Siamese or YOLO independently for analysis.

Download & Run

Go to the Releases section.

Download the latest Airavat-Setup.exe.

RAM: 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended for large datasets)

Disk Space: At least 250 GB free for maximum dataset size (200 GB ZIP + extraction + results)

GPU: Optional — NVIDIA GPU speeds up processing, but CPU-only works too

Expected Use

Identify elephants in bulk photo archives.

Compare model outputs for research.

Support conservation by enabling offline tracking in the field.
